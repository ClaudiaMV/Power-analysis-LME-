# Power-analysis-LME-
This R script simulates data for mixed-effects modelling and performs a power simulation to estimate the sample size needed to detect fixed effects. It generates a dataset with random participant effects, nested predictors, and an outcome variable. Using the `lme4` and `simr` packages, it fits a model, extends the sample size, and calculates power.
